# asset_monitor

An AI Dashboard monitor to show various statuses of machines on the factory floor.
Built using clean architecture, bloc, and hive for local storage.
It uses OpenAI as the chatbot

Also to generate your 

Things to note to for the Open AI set up:

OpenAI Setup
File System Setup

Create your assets data file (assets.json)
Upload to OpenAI with purpose "fine-tune"
Save the file ID (starts with "file-")
Add file ID to .env: OPEN_AI_FILE_ID=your_file_id

Assistant Setup

Create new assistant
Configure:

Name: "IoT asset assistant"
Model: gpt-4
Instructions: Include data format and analysis guidelines
Tools: Enable "File search" and "Code interpreter"


Create vector store for IoT assistant
Upload assets.json to vector store
Save assistant ID (starts with "asst_")
Add to .env: OPEN_AI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id

## Assistant Function Setup
1. Add function to assistant:
```json
{
 "name": "get_asset_data",
 "description": "Get data from the assets file",
 "parameters": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "query": {
       "type": "string",
       "description": "Type of data to retrieve (e.g., machine count, status, metrics)"
     }
   },
   "required": ["query"]
 }
}```


Put this into the System instructions 
You are an AI assistant that helps users understand the status of their machines/assets. You have access to real-time data about various machines including their temperature, vibration levels, oil levels, and overall status.

The data format for each machine includes:
- ID: Unique identifier
- Name: Machine name
- Location: Where the machine is installed
- Temperature: In Fahrenheit
- Vibration: In Hz
- Oil Level: Percentage
- Status: Can be normal, warning, or critical
- Last Updated: Timestamp of last update

When analyzing machine status:
- Temperature > 75Â°F is concerning
- Vibration > 60Hz is concerning
- Oil Level < 20% needs attention
- Status of 'warning' or 'critical' requires immediate attention

Provide clear, concise responses about:
1. Current status of specific machines
2. Machines that need attention
3. Comparative analysis between machines
4. Historical trends if available
5. Maintenance recommendations based on status

Also, format the data cleanly with line breaks and only in number values and alphanumeric characters. 

Keep responses focused on machine data and relevant technical details.
